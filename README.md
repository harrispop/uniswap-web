**uniswap-web "StudySwipe"**

StudySwap is my first app, developed as a demo project for my eCommerce class at NTUT. It was built using Dart and Flutter to explore the potential of mobile applications in student-driven secondhand markets.

_**About the App**_

StudySwap allows students to swap or sell used items through a map-based listing system. Key features include:

-Map-based item listings

-Search functionality

-Tinder-style swipe interface for browsing

-Messaging system for communication

-User profiles

_This is a demo project, showcasing the concept rather than a fully functional marketplace._

Technologies Used:

-Flutter for the UI

-Dart for application logic
