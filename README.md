uniswap-web "StudySwipe"

StudySwap
StudySwap is my first app, developed as a demo project for my eCommerce class at NTUT. It was built using Dart and Flutter to explore the potential of mobile applications in student-driven secondhand markets.

About the App
StudySwap allows students to swap or sell used items through a map-based listing system. Key features include:

Map-based item listings

Search functionality

Tinder-style swipe interface for browsing

Messaging system for communication

User profiles

This is a demo project, showcasing the concept rather than a fully functional marketplace.

Technologies Used
Flutter for the UI

Dart for application logic
