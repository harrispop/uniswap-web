# StudySwap

**StudySwap** is my first app, developed as a demo project for my eCommerce class at **NTUT**. It was built using **Dart** and **Flutter** to explore the potential of mobile applications in student-driven secondhand markets.

## 📌 About the App

StudySwap allows students to swap or sell used items through a map-based listing system.  

### ✨ Features  
- 📍 **Map-based item listings**  
- 🔍 **Search functionality**  
- 🔄 **Tinder-style swipe interface for browsing**  
- 💬 **Messaging system for communication**  
- 👤 **User profiles**  

⚠ **Note:** This is a **demo project**, showcasing the concept rather than a fully functional marketplace.  

##  Technologies Used

-  **Dart** for application logic
